            <h1>Where I am From</h1>
            <p class="bk"> 
             I am from here in San Jose and I have much of my family here and also other parts of California. I enjoy being here and I have lots of fun but I want to change my life with my education and get a better life than the one that I have now even though I have no compaints and I am happy. Many memebers of my family are from Mexico like my dad and my grandma.

            <h1> What I do Now</h1>
            <p class="bk">I like to play lots of football and video games, as you can see i put a gaming logo up top that is pretty big because gaming means alot to me personally.. I want to play football in college but I don't know if I want to make it my career. I may want to play video games profesionally. I do know that I want to go to a good college and get a good education. I do enjoy science and computer science. I like the concept of coding and graphic design. </p>
